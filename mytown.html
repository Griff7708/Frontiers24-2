          <h1>My Town</h1>
          <p>As I mentioned before, I'm from San Antonio, Texas.</p>
          <p>Located in the southern part of Texas, San Antonio is home to a
            much wider variety of cultures. The most prevalent by far is that of
            Mexican decent. Often called "Tex-Mex" food, Mexican cuisines have
            somewhat changed due to the influence of other cultures.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p><img src="images/download.jfif" alt="" style="width: 194px; height: 120px;"></p>
          <p>San Antonio is also sometimes referred to as "Military City"
            because it is home to the largest military base in the United
            States. The reason for this is simply that Joint Base San Antonio
            (JBSA) is just that, a joint base. The joint base combines four
            other military bases (Camp Bullis, Fort Sam Houston, Lackland AFB
            and Randolph AFB) into one larger military installation.</p>
          <p><img src="images/OIP.jfif" alt="" style="width: 204px; height: 120px;"></p>
          <p>The city also offers a rich look into Texan history, especially in
            relation the Texas Revolutionary war. The Spanish had implemented a
            "Mission System" in order to convert Native Americans into
            Catholics, and the buildings that remained have continued to stand
            since. One of these Missions, called the Alamo, was used to fight
            off Santa Anna during Texas's war with Mexico, and has since been a
            large piece of the San Antonio culture.</p>

          <p>As well, San Antonio has its own NBA team, the San Antonio Spurs.
            Notably, the team has had several fantastic players such as Tim
            Duncan, David Robinson, George Gervin, and Tony Parker.</p>
