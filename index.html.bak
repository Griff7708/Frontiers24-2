          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <p> I first discovered the Frontiers Program while searching for a
            college program to attend over the summer. While checking my email
            to see if I had been sent any recommendations, I came across an
            email suggesting Frontiers. Although some people around me felt that
            it wasn't the best option, I continued to push through in order to
            be able to attend. </p>
          <p> In the day that I have been here, I've had a wonderful experience
            and I feel that it was completely worth it. I have made a few
            friends and I have had so much fun with them. </p>
          <p> I don't know what the remainder of my stay here will be like, but
            I am sure that it will be just as great. I appreciate the
            opportunity to be here and I will try to make the most of it. </p>
